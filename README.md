## Project Description
The **Stock Market Analysis** project focuses on understanding the behavior and performance of the stock market by analyzing historical data. The project involves identifying trends, patterns, and anomalies in stock prices, volumes, and indices over time. By leveraging various statistical and visualization tools, we aim to provide insights into stock performance, volatility, and market trends. This analysis is valuable for investors, analysts, and researchers aiming to make data-driven decisions.

- **Line Plot:** Display stock price trends over time.
- **Bar Plot:** Show annual trading volume for each stock.
- **Box Plot:** Highlight the distribution of closing prices.
- **Scatter Plot:** Visualize stock price vs. volume for each stock.
- **Heatmap:** Correlation matrix to identify relationships between stocks.

### 4. Key Metrics:
- Calculate and plot the moving average (SMA/EMA) for selected stocks.
